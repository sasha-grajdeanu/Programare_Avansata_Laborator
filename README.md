## Laboratorul nr.2

Pus pe Github partea de COMPULSORY si HOMEWORK

### COMPULSORY (*solved*)

- Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: Location, Road.
The location and road types will be implemented as enums. (*solved*)
- Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters. (*solved*)

- Create and print on the screen various objects of the two classes. (*solved*)

### HOMEWORK

- Create a class that describes an instance of the problem. (*solved*)
- Override the Object.equals method for the Location and Road classes. The problem should not allow adding the same location or road twice. (*solved*)

- Implement a method that determines if a problem's instance is valid. (*solved*)
- Implement an algorithm for determining if it is possible to go from one location to another using the given roads. (*solved*)
- Write doc comments in your source code and generate the class documentation using javadoc. (*solved*)

## Laboratorul nr.3

### Compulsory

  - list: prints the list of documents on the screen;
  - view: opens a document using the native operating system application (see the Desktop class);

## Laboratorul nr. 6

### Compulsory

Create the following components:

  selecting the dots or the line itself. Validate the moves, according to the game rules. Determine the winner of the
  game. (*solved*)

## Laboratorul nr. 7

### Compulsory

- Create an object oriented model of the problem. (*solved*)
- Each robot will have a name and they must perform in a concurrent manner, moving randomly around the map and extracting tokens from the shared memory when reaching an unvisited cell. A message will be displayed on the screen every time a robot visits a new cell. (*solved*)
- __Simulate the exploration using a thread for each robot.__  Pay attention to the synchronization of the threads when extracting tokens and when visiting cells. (*solved*)

### Homework


- Implement the commands that start/pause the robots (all of them or only a specific one). A robot can be paused for a specific time or indefinitely, requiring a start command. The commands must be given using the keyboard. (*kinda solved*)
- Design an algorithm such that each robots will try to explore the map in a systematic fashion, ensuring the termination of the exploration process. (*solved*)
- Implement a timekeeper thread that runs concurrently with the player threads, as a daemon. This thread will display the running time of the exploration and it will stop it exceeds a certain time limit. (*solved*)

- Two albums are related if they meet at least one of the following conditions: are composed by the same artist or have been released in the same year or have at least one common genre.
Create an algorithm that generates maximal playlists (all of them or a limited number, if there are too many) that contain only unrelated albums. (*NO*)


## Laboratorul nr. 9

### Compulsory
- Create a persistence unit (use EclipseLink or Hibernate or other JPA implementation). 
- Verify the presence of the persistence.xml file in your project. Make sure that the driver for EclipseLink or Hibernate was added to to your project classpath (or add it yourself). 
- Define the entity classes for your model (at least one) and put them in a dedicated package. You may use the IDE support in order to generate entity classes from database tables. 
- Create a singleton responsible with the management of an EntityManagerFactory object. 
- Define repository clases for your entities (at least one). They must contain the following methods:
  - create - receives an entity and saves it into the database;
  - findById - returns an entity based on its primary key;
  - findByName - returns a list of entities that match a given name pattern. Use a named query in order to implement this method. 
- Test your application. 

### Homework
- Create all entity classes and repositories. Implement properly the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
- Create a generic AbstractRepository using generics in order to simplify the creation of the repository classes. You may take a look at the CrudRepository interface from Spring Framework.
- Insert, using JPA, a large number of fake artists and albums in the database and log the execution time of your JPQL statements.
