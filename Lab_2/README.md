## COMPULSORY (*solved*)

- Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: Location, Road.
The location and road types will be implemented as enums. (*solved*)
- Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters. (*solved*)
- The toString method form the Object class must be properly overridden for all the classes. (*solved*)
- Create and print on the screen various objects of the two classes. (*solved*)

## HOMEWORK

- Create a class that describes an instance of the problem. (*solved*)
- Override the Object.equals method for the Location and Road classes. The problem should not allow adding the same location or road twice. (*solved*)
- Instead of using an enum, create dedicated classes either for locations: cities, air ports, gas stations etc. or roads: highway, express, country, etc. Each concrete location class may have additional specific propertes (population, number of terminals, gas price, etc.) (*solved*)
- Implement a method that determines if a problem's instance is valid. (*solved*)
- Implement an algorithm for determining if it is possible to go from one location to another using the given roads. (*solved*)
- Write doc comments in your source code and generate the class documentation using javadoc. (*solved*)
