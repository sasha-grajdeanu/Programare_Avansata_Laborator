# Laboratorul nr. 9

## Compulsory
- Create a persistence unit (use EclipseLink or Hibernate or other JPA implementation). 
- Verify the presence of the persistence.xml file in your project. Make sure that the driver for EclipseLink or Hibernate was added to to your project classpath (or add it yourself). 
- Define the entity classes for your model (at least one) and put them in a dedicated package. You may use the IDE support in order to generate entity classes from database tables. 
- Create a singleton responsible with the management of an EntityManagerFactory object. 
- Define repository clases for your entities (at least one). They must contain the following methods:
  - create - receives an entity and saves it into the database;
  - findById - returns an entity based on its primary key;
  - findByName - returns a list of entities that match a given name pattern. Use a named query in order to implement this method. 
- Test your application. 

## Homework
- Create all entity classes and repositories. Implement properly the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
- Create a generic AbstractRepository using generics in order to simplify the creation of the repository classes. You may take a look at the CrudRepository interface from Spring Framework.
- Insert, using JPA, a large number of fake artists and albums in the database and log the execution time of your JPQL statements.
